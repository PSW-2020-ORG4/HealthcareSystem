# HealthcareSystem

HealthcareSystem is a student project for the PSW course in 2020/2021 at FTN Novi Sad. The course focuses on topics such as Agile Software Development, Test Driven Development, and Domain Driven Design, which are applied in this project. The goal of the project is to create a software system for a hospital, consisting of three parts:
- *PatientWebApp*, a web application for patients which would provide features such as online appointment scheduling,
- *GraphicalEditor*, a desktop application which provides a map view of the hospital for easy visualization and management of resources and schedule,
- *IntegrationAdapters*, which provide integration with pharmacy systems.
